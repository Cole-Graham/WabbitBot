# Refactoring Log: Step 6.5 - Legacy Closure and Gap Remediation

## 6.5a: Implement Unified ErrorService Architecture

**Date:** 2025-09-23

### Summary
This step established the foundation for a new, unified error handling service. The goal was to create a centralized, consistent, and extensible mechanism for error logging, notification, and recovery, mirroring the successful pattern of the `DatabaseService`.

### Key Actions
1.  **Directory and Namespace:**
    *   Created a new directory and namespace `WabbitBot.Common.ErrorService` to house the new components.
    *   This location was chosen to allow the `ErrorService` to be shared between the `WabbitBot.Core` and `WabbitBot.DiscBot` projects, ensuring a consistent error handling strategy across the application.

2.  **Component Creation:**
    *   **`IErrorService.cs`**: Defined the public contract for the service, including `HandleAsync` and `CaptureAsync` methods.
    *   **`ErrorContext.cs`**: Created an immutable class to carry detailed information about an error, including the exception, severity, operation name, and a correlation ID.
    *   **`ErrorComponent.cs`**: Implemented an enum to specify which part of the error handling pipeline to invoke (e.g., `Logging`, `Notification`, `Recovery`).
    *   **`ErrorSeverity.cs`**: Defined an enum for error severity levels (`Critical`, `Error`, `Warning`, `Information`).

3.  **Partial Class Implementation:**
    *   **`ErrorService.cs`**: The main partial class implements `IErrorService` and contains the central `HandleAsync` method, which acts as a dispatcher.
    *   **`ErrorService.Logging.cs`**: Partial class providing a placeholder implementation for logging errors to the console.
    *   **`ErrorService.Notification.cs`**: Partial class providing a placeholder for sending notifications based on error severity.
    *   **`ErrorService.Recovery.cs`**: Partial class providing a placeholder for critical error recovery logic.

4.  **Build and Validation:**
    *   Corrected initial build errors related to `async void` partial methods by changing their signatures to return `Task`.
    *   The `WabbitBot.Common` project now compiles successfully with the new `ErrorService` foundation.

### Outcome
The foundational components of the `ErrorService` are now in place within the `WabbitBot.Common` project. The architecture is clean, extensible, and ready for integration into other services like `CoreService`.

### Next Steps
-   Proceed with Step 6.5b: Migrating remaining legacy data access patterns to the unified `DatabaseService`.
-   Integrate the new `IErrorService` into `CoreService` and other top-level services.
-   Begin replacing ad-hoc `try/catch` blocks and old error handlers with calls to the new `ErrorService`.

## 6.5b: Complete `DatabaseService` Migration

**Date:** 2025-09-23

### Summary
This step involved a comprehensive refactoring of all remaining feature slices to remove the legacy `DataServiceManager` and adopt the new unified `DatabaseService`. This was a critical step in modernizing the data access layer.

### Key Actions
1.  **Code Identification:** Performed a global search for `DataServiceManager` to identify all remaining usages, which were primarily located in the `Leaderboards`, `Scrimmages`, and `Matches` vertical slices, as well as in the `DiscBot` event handlers.
2.  **Architectural Correction:** After several iterations and clarifications, the correct usage pattern for the `DatabaseService` was established. The `DatabaseService` itself was refactored to encapsulate high-level coordination logic (e.g., cache-then-repository) within its public methods, dramatically simplifying the downstream code.
3.  **Event Refactoring:** Identified that many event classes were still using `string` for entity IDs. Refactored `SeasonEvents.cs` and `ScrimmageEvents.cs` to use `Guid` properties, enforcing type safety.
4.  **Core Class Refactoring:** Refactored `SeasonCore.cs`, `LeaderboardCore.cs`, `RatingCalculatorService.cs`, and created the new `MatchCore.cs`. All these classes now correctly use the high-level `DatabaseService` methods.
5.  **Handler Refactoring:** Refactored `SeasonHandler.cs` and `ScrimmageDiscordEventHandler.cs` to use the updated `Guid`-based events and the correct `DatabaseService` methods, while also adding `// TODO` comments to flag where event payloads need to be enriched to avoid database lookups in handlers.

### Outcome
All legacy data access patterns have been successfully removed from the active codebase. The `Core` classes are now leaner and focused purely on business logic, and the `DatabaseService` provides a robust, centralized, and easy-to-use API for all data operations.

## 6.5c: Clean Up Legacy DI and Event Bus Hooks

**Date:** 2025-09-23

### Summary
This step focused on removing the last remnants of the old dependency injection system.

### Key Actions
1.  **DI Keyword Search:** Searched for common DI keywords (`IServiceProvider`, `AddScoped`, etc.) and found a lingering `AddSingleton` call in `DatabaseServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`.
2.  **Legacy File Removal:** Deleted the `DatabaseServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` file as it was entirely related to the old DI setup.
3.  **Configuration Refactoring:** Migrated the robust `DbContext` configuration logic from the deleted file into the static `WabbitBotDbContextProvider`.
4.  **Startup Code Update:** Updated `Program.cs` to pass the `IConfiguration` object to the `WabbitBotDbContextProvider`, finalizing the move to a direct-instantiation-with-configuration model.

### Outcome
All traces of the legacy runtime DI container have been purged from the application's startup and configuration code, solidifying the project's commitment to a direct instantiation architecture.

## 6.5d: Align Test Suite

**Date:** 2025-09-23

### Summary
This step involved assessing the state of the test suite after the major architectural changes.

### Key Actions
1.  **Test Project Discovery:** Searched for test projects and individual test files within the solution.
2.  **Analysis:** Found a single test file, `EntityConfigTests.cs`, which was testing a legacy `EntityConfigFactory` pattern that is no longer in use.
3.  **Action:** Determined that deleting the test file and the factory it tests is the correct course of action, as they are not relevant to the new architecture. The file and factory were subsequently deleted.

### Outcome
No active test suites required updating as a result of the refactoring. The only existing test file was for a deprecated pattern and has been removed, leaving a clean slate for future testing efforts against the new architecture.

### Next Steps
-   Proceed with Step 6.6: Application & Database Versioning Strategy.
-   Begin adding new integration and unit tests for the refactored `Core` services and the `DatabaseService`.
