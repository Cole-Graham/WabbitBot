  │   │   ├── 📁 .trash  <-- when you're trying to clean up but not sure if you wanna delete
  │   │   │   └── 📄 .gitkeep <-- because .trash is in .gitignore

  │   ├── 📄 SomeFeatureGuide.md
  │   ├── 📄 SomeOtherDoc.md
  │   └── 📄 etc.md

#      ^ standard docs still go in root

# DON'T CREATE PERSONAL .gitignore'd SUBFOLDERS OR FILES IN DOCS
# As a general rule try to limit how many personal entries you have in .gitignore
