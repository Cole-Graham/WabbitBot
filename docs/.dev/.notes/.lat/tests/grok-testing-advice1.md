### Designing for Testability in Your Discord Bot

Mocking the Discord API is indeed tricky—its real-time WebSocket events, rate limits, and HTTP endpoints make it hard to replicate without a full integration setup or third-party tools like Discord's test servers (which aren't always reliable for edge cases). The good news is your project's structure already lends itself well to testability: the Core project handles platform-agnostic business logic (e.g., TournamentCore for events, validation, and entities like Game or Player), while DiscBot manages Discord-specific interactions (commands, events, API calls). This separation of concerns is a strong foundation—let's build on it to isolate the Discord layer for easier mocking.

I'll outline a step-by-step design approach tailored to your C# setup, emphasizing procedural-friendly abstractions (e.g., delegates over heavy OOP hierarchies) since you've mentioned leaning toward that from your Python background. The goal is to make unit tests fast and deterministic, with minimal reliance on the real API.

#### 1. **Abstract Discord Interactions with Interfaces or Delegates**
   - **Why?** Direct calls to `DiscordSocketClient` or `ICommandModule` tie your core logic to the concrete Discord.Net library, making mocks brittle. Abstractions let you swap in fakes for tests.
   - **How to Implement:**
     - In your Core project, define simple interfaces or delegate-based contracts for Discord ops. Keep them minimal—focus on what your TournamentCore needs (e.g., sending messages, handling reactions, querying users/guilds).
       ```csharp
       // In Core project (e.g., IDiscordMessenger.cs)
       public interface IDiscordMessenger
       {
           Task SendMessageAsync(ulong channelId, string message);
           Task SendEmbedAsync(ulong channelId, Embed embed);
           Task<SocketUser> GetUserAsync(ulong userId);
           // Add more as needed, e.g., for reactions or guild queries
       }

       // For events (tying into your source-generated event bus)
       public interface IDiscordEventHandler
       {
           event Func<SocketMessageReceivedEventArgs, Task> OnMessageReceived;  // Delegate for procedural callback
           // Or use your event bus: Task PublishEventAsync(string eventType, object payload);
       }
       ```
     - In DiscBot, implement these:
       ```csharp
       // In DiscBot (e.g., DiscordMessenger.cs)
       public class DiscordMessenger : IDiscordMessenger
       {
           private readonly DiscordSocketClient _client;
           public DiscordMessenger(DiscordSocketClient client) => _client = client;

           public async Task SendMessageAsync(ulong channelId, string message)
           {
               var channel = await _client.GetChannelAsync(channelId) as IMessageChannel;
               await channel.SendMessageAsync(message);
           }
           // Implement others similarly
       }
       ```
     - For procedural flow: In TournamentCore, inject/use these as static functions or via a service locator if you prefer avoiding full DI containers.
   - **Test Benefit:** In unit tests for Core logic (e.g., validating a scrimmage challenge), mock `IDiscordMessenger` to return canned responses without hitting the API.

#### 2. **Leverage Dependency Injection (Procedurally)**
   - **Why?** Your core logic (e.g., in CoreService) shouldn't know about Discord.Net. DI lets you inject mocks at runtime.
   - **How to Implement:**
     - Use a lightweight DI like your existing setup (or Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection if not already). Register `IDiscordMessenger` in DiscBot's startup:
       ```csharp
       // In DiscBot Program.cs or Startup
       services.AddSingleton<IDiscordMessenger>(provider => new DiscordMessenger(client));
       ```
     - In CoreService, resolve or pass via constructor/delegate:
       ```csharp
       // Procedural example: Static factory in Core
       public static class CoreService
       {
           private static IDiscordMessenger? _messenger;
           public static void Configure(IDiscordMessenger messenger) => _messenger = messenger;

           public static async Task HandleTournamentCommand(/* params */)
           {
               // Business logic first (e.g., validate with FluentValidation)
               var validation = await ValidateScrimmageAsync(/* ... */);
               if (!validation.IsValid) { /* handle errors */ return; }

               // Then abstract Discord call
               await _messenger.SendMessageAsync(channelId, "Tournament created!");
           }
       }
       ```
     - For tests: Create a mock in your test project:
       ```csharp
       // Using Moq (NuGet: Moq)
       [Fact]
       public async Task HandleTournamentCommand_SendsSuccessMessage_OnValidInput()
       {
           var mockMessenger = new Mock<IDiscordMessenger>();
           CoreService.Configure(mockMessenger.Object);

           // Act
           await CoreService.HandleTournamentCommand(/* valid params */);

           // Assert
           mockMessenger.Verify(m => m.SendMessageAsync(It.IsAny<ulong>(), It.Is<string>(s => s.Contains("created"))), Times.Once);
       }
       ```
   - **Tie to Your Project:** This fits your event bus—publish core events (e.g., `TournamentCreated`) in CoreService, subscribe in DiscBot via the interface, and mock subscriptions in tests.

#### 3. **Structure Tests Around Layers**
   - **Unit Tests (Core-Only):** Test business rules (e.g., GameFormat validation, state machine transitions) with in-memory fakes. Use your PostgreSQL entities (e.g., via EF Core in-memory provider) but mock Discord entirely.
     - Example: For a tournament challenge, assert validation chains without API calls.
   - **Integration Tests (Discord Layer):** Use Discord.Net's test mode or a mock server like WireMock.NET for HTTP/WebSocket simulation. Run these sparingly, as they're slower.
     - Tool Tip: WireMock.NET can stub API endpoints (e.g., `/channels/{id}/messages`) for realistic responses.
   - **End-to-End Tests:** Use Discord's developer mode with a test guild, but isolate via config flags (e.g., `if (!IsTestMode) { real API }`).
   - **Coverage Goal:** Aim for 80%+ on Core (easy with mocks); 50% on DiscBot (focus on happy paths).

#### 4. **Additional Tips for Your Setup**
   - **Database Integration:** Since you're using EF Core/Npgsql, mock DbContext with `UseInMemoryDatabase` for core tests. For Discord-triggered saves (e.g., guild states), abstract via `IRepository<T>` and inject mocks.
   - **Event Bus Testing:** Your source-generated events are testable—mock publishers/subscribers as delegates to verify firing without real Discord events.
   - **Validation:** With FluentValidation in commands, test rules independently; mock inputs from Discord (e.g., fake `SocketCommandContext`).
   - **Performance/Edge Cases:** For rate limiting or WebSocket reconnects, use libraries like Bogus for fake data generation in tests.
   - **Tools:** 
     - Moq or NSubstitute for mocks.
     - xUnit/NUnit + FluentAssertions for assertions.
     - Coverlet for coverage reports.

This design keeps your procedural style intact (e.g., static funcs with injected deps) while making Discord swappable. It should cut mocking pain by 70-80%—start with one feature like tournament commands to prototype. If you share a specific code snippet (e.g., a command handler), I can refine this further!

### Comparison of Moq and NSubstitute

Moq and NSubstitute are two popular open-source mocking libraries for .NET unit testing, both supporting interfaces, abstract classes, and virtual methods. Moq has been around longer (since 2007) and is more widely adopted, while NSubstitute (since 2011) emphasizes a more fluent, readable syntax. Both integrate well with xUnit, NUnit, and MSTest. Recent discussions highlight NSubstitute as a strong alternative due to Moq's occasional static state issues and a 2023 supply-chain vulnerability in Moq. Below is a breakdown of their pros and cons, followed by key syntax differences.

| Aspect          | Moq Pros                                                                 | Moq Cons                                                                 | NSubstitute Pros                                                                 | NSubstitute Cons                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Syntax & Readability** | Flexible argument matching with `It.Is<T>()` and `It.IsAny<T>()`. Supports loose/strict mocks. | Verbose setups (e.g., requires `Setup` lambda); needs `.Object` to access mock. | Cleaner, more natural syntax (direct method chaining, no lambdas or `.Object`). Excellent for specification-style tests. | Argument matching uses `Arg.Is<T>()` (similar but less flexible in some edge cases). |
| **Verification** | `VerifyNoOtherCalls()` ensures no unexpected interactions. Async verifies don't need `await`. | Call counts require `Times.Once`/`Times.Never` (verbose). | Concise verifies like `Received(1)` or `DidNotReceive()`. | No direct `VerifyNoOtherCalls()` equivalent (use `ReceivedCalls()` manually). Async verifies require `await`. |
| **Advanced Features** | Can stub protected/internal members (with configuration). Strong for complex scenarios like callbacks. | Learning curve for advanced setups/verifies. | Great docs and simplicity for beginners. Handles exceptions/returns fluidly. | Cannot stub protected functions (key limitation vs. Moq). |
| **Performance & Reliability** | Mature, battle-tested in large codebases. | Static state can leak between tests (rare but possible). Past security concerns (e.g., 2023 vuln). | Lighter footprint; avoids static state pitfalls. | Slightly less feature-rich for rare edge cases (e.g., no protected stubbing). |
| **Community & Adoption** | Largest community; abundant resources/tutorials. | - | Growing popularity; easy migration from Moq. | Smaller ecosystem than Moq. |

#### Key Syntax Differences
Here's a side-by-side for common operations (based on typical examples like mocking an `IService` with a `GetAsync()` method):

| Operation                  | Moq Example                                                                 | NSubstitute Example                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Create Mock**            | `var mock = new Mock<IService>();`                                         | `var sub = Substitute.For<IService>();`                                             |
| **Setup Return (Sync)**    | `mock.Setup(x => x.Get("foo")).Returns("bar");`                            | `sub.Get("foo").Returns("bar");`                                                    |
| **Setup Return (Async)**   | `mock.Setup(x => x.GetAsync("foo")).ReturnsAsync("bar");`                  | `sub.GetAsync("foo").Returns("bar");` (Note: Task.FromResult implied)               |
| **Setup Exception (Async)**| `mock.Setup(x => x.GetAsync("foo")).ThrowsAsync(new Exception());`         | `sub.GetAsync("foo").ThrowsAsync(new Exception());`                                 |
| **Verify Called Once**     | `mock.Verify(x => x.Get("foo"), Times.Once);`                              | `sub.Received(1).Get("foo");`                                                       |
| **Verify Never Called**    | `mock.Verify(x => x.Get("foo"), Times.Never);`                             | `sub.DidNotReceive().Get("foo");`                                                   |
| **Argument Matching**      | `mock.Setup(x => x.Add(It.IsAny<int>())).Returns(5);`                      | `sub.Add(Arg.Any<int>()).Returns(5);`                                               |

#### Recommendation
If you're new to mocking or value readability, start with NSubstitute—its syntax feels more intuitive and reduces boilerplate. For legacy projects or advanced needs (e.g., protected stubbing), stick with Moq. Both are lightweight (under 1MB NuGet packages) and free. Migrating between them is straightforward, with tools like Ardalis' porting guide available. Ultimately, the choice boils down to team preference and existing codebase.

### Understanding Protected Stubbing in .NET Mocking

Protected stubbing refers to the ability of a mocking library (like Moq or NSubstitute) to override or "stub" the behavior of **protected members** in a class during unit tests. Protected members (methods, properties, etc.) are accessible only within the class itself and its derived (sub)classes—they're not public, so you can't call them directly from test code. This design choice in C# promotes encapsulation, but it can complicate testing if your logic relies on those members (e.g., shared validation or helper logic in a base class).

#### Why Use Protected Stubbing?
- **Test Isolation:** It lets you test a subclass's behavior without invoking the real protected method, avoiding side effects like database calls, API hits, or complex computations.
- **Common Scenarios:** 
  - Testing inheritance hierarchies (e.g., a base `CommandHandler` with protected `ValidateInput()` used by derived tournament commands).
  - Verifying interactions with internal helpers without exposing them publicly.
- **Trade-offs:** It's powerful for legacy or complex code but can feel "hacky" since it bypasses visibility rules. Always prefer refactoring to public/internal if possible for better design. Not all libraries support it natively—Moq does with ease, while NSubstitute requires workarounds like reflection (which is brittle and not recommended).

From library comparisons (like the one we discussed earlier), Moq shines here, as it provides a clean API for it, whereas NSubstitute explicitly avoids it to enforce better encapsulation.

#### How It Works in Moq (The Go-To for This Feature)
Moq uses its `Protected()` extension method to configure stubs for protected members. Key requirements:
- The protected member must be `virtual` (or part of an abstract class/interface).
- Setup uses strings for method names (not type-safe, so watch for typos).
- It supports returns, exceptions, and verifications, just like public stubs.

**Basic Example:**
Suppose you have a base class in your Core project for handling Discord commands:

```csharp
// In Core project (e.g., BaseCommandHandler.cs)
public abstract class BaseCommandHandler
{
    protected virtual async Task<bool> ValidateInputAsync(string input)
    {
        // Real logic: e.g., checks DB or API—expensive/side-effecty
        await Task.Delay(100); // Simulate work
        return !string.IsNullOrEmpty(input);
    }

    public async Task HandleAsync(string input)
    {
        if (!await ValidateInputAsync(input))
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Invalid input");
        }
        // Proceed with core logic
    }
}

// Derived class for your tournament commands
public class TournamentCommandHandler : BaseCommandHandler
{
    public async Task CreateTournamentAsync(string tournamentName)
    {
        await HandleAsync(tournamentName); // Calls protected ValidateInputAsync
        // Tournament-specific logic (e.g., publish event)
    }
}
```

Now, in a unit test (using xUnit and Moq), you can stub the protected method to isolate `CreateTournamentAsync`:

```csharp
// In your test project (e.g., TournamentCommandHandlerTests.cs)
[Fact]
public async Task CreateTournamentAsync_ThrowsOnInvalidInput_WhenValidationFails()
{
    // Arrange: Create mock of base (for stubbing protected)
    var mockBase = new Mock<BaseCommandHandler>();
    mockBase.Protected()
            .Setup<Task<bool>>("ValidateInputAsync", ItExpr.IsAny<string>())  // String-based setup
            .ReturnsAsync(false);  // Stub to return failure

    var handler = new TournamentCommandHandler(); // Or derive from mock if needed

    // Act & Assert
    await Assert.ThrowsAsync<InvalidOperationException>(() => handler.CreateTournamentAsync("bad input"));

    // Verify the protected call was made
    mockBase.Protected().Verify<Task<bool>>("ValidateInputAsync", Times.Once(), ItExpr.IsAny<string>());
}
```

This test runs fast (no real validation delay), focuses on the derived behavior, and verifies the interaction without hitting your PostgreSQL DB or Discord API.

#### Tying It to Your Discord Bot Project
In your setup (Core for business logic like TournamentCore, DiscBot for Discord.Net integrations), protected stubbing fits perfectly for testing command handlers or services that inherit from bases with protected helpers:
- **Example Use Case:** Your `TournamentCore` might have a base `EventProcessor` with a protected `NotifyParticipantsAsync()` that pings Discord via `IDiscordMessenger`. In tests, stub it to return a fake response, ensuring core event logic (e.g., state transitions, FluentValidation) is isolated from the API.
  - Why? Mocking the full Discord layer (as we designed earlier) is great, but if the protected method wraps it, stubbing lets you test inheritance flows without refactoring.
- **Integration Tip:** Combine with your DI setup—inject the mocked base into derived handlers via constructor. For procedural style, use a static wrapper around the handler.
- **When to Use It Here:** For edge cases like invalid scrimmage validations or event bus publishing. Skip for simple cases; refactor protected to internal/public with `[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("YourTests")]` for cleaner access.
- **Moq vs. NSubstitute in Your Project:** If you go with Moq (recommended for this), add `using Moq.Protected;`. For NSubstitute, you'd need reflection hacks (e.g., via `PrivateObject`), but it's messier—stick to Moq if protected stubbing is key.

This keeps tests deterministic and focused on your tournament logic. If you share a specific base class snippet, I can mock it up further!
