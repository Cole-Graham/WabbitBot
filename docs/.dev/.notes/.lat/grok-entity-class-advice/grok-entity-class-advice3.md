###### Prompt:

1. Should this Match entity list the Games property as a list of FKs, Game instances, or both? If the answer is both, should it be two separate properties? or a single property, like a dictionary mapping FKs to instances?

2. When Match entity instances are stored in the database, does the database create a copy of the Game instances in the Games property, what exactly is the database storing for that property?

3. Followup to question 2, are there any risks of data-drift when navigational properties refer to instances of other classes?

 
  public partial class Match : Entity
{
    // Core match data (keep essential fields)
    public TeamSize TeamSize { get; set; }
    public DateTime? StartedAt { get; set; }
    public DateTime? CompletedAt { get; set; }
    public Guid? WinnerId { get; set; }
    public Guid? ParentId { get; set; } // ID of parent Scrimmage or Tournament
    public string? ParentType { get; set; } // "Scrimmage" or "Tournament"
    public List<Game> Games { get; set; } = new();
    public int BestOf { get; set; } = 1; // Number of games to win the match
    public bool PlayToCompletion { get; set; } // Whether all games must be played even after winner is determined
    // Navigation properties (following existing patterns)
    public List<MatchParticipant> Participants { get; set; } = new();
    public List<TeamOpponentEncounter> OpponentEncounters { get; set; } = new();
    // Map ban properties
    public List<string> AvailableMaps { get; set; } = new(); // Maps available for the match
    public List<string> Team1MapBans { get; set; } = new(); // Maps banned by team 1
    public List<string> Team2MapBans { get; set; } = new(); // Maps banned by team 2
    public DateTime? Team1MapBansSubmittedAt { get; set; }
    public DateTime? Team2MapBansSubmittedAt { get; set; }
    // Discord Thread Management
    public ulong? ChannelId { get; set; } // Discord channel ID where the match threads are created
    public ulong? Team1ThreadId { get; set; } // Discord thread ID for Team 1 (private thread)
    public ulong? Team2ThreadId { get; set; } // Discord thread ID for Team 2 (private thread)
    // State Management Properties - StateHistory stored as JSONB
    public List<MatchStateSnapshot> StateHistory { get; set; } = new();
}

### 1. Should the `Games` Property Be a List of FKs, Game Instances, or Both? (And Format if Both)
**Both**—but lean on the `List<Game>` (instances) as the primary navigational property, with the FK (`Guid MatchId`) handled implicitly in the `Game` entity. This follows EF Core best practices for owned/child collections in a 1:N relationship (one Match owns many Games). Don't store a separate list of FKs in `Match`; that would denormalize unnecessarily and risk inconsistency.

#### Why Both (But FK on the Child Side)?
- **List<Game> Instances (Navigation)**: Essential for traversing the relationship (e.g., `match.Games.First().Score`). EF Core uses this to eager-load via `Include(m => m.Games)` or lazy-load if `virtual`. It keeps your procedural code clean—query once, access directly without manual joins.
- **Guid MatchId FK (in Game)**: The "glue" for integrity. Define it in `Game` as `public Guid MatchId { get; set; }`, and EF enforces it via Fluent API (e.g., `builder.HasOne<Game>().WithMany(m => m.Games).HasForeignKey(g => g.MatchId);`). This ensures referential integrity without bloating `Match`.

#### Separate Properties vs. Dictionary?
- **Two Separate Properties? No**—Redundant and error-prone (e.g., syncing `List<Guid> GameIds` with `List<Game> Games` manually). EF handles the mapping; adding a raw `List<Guid>` would just duplicate effort.
- **Single Dictionary (e.g., `Dictionary<Guid, Game>`)? No**—Overkill unless Games have non-sequential keys (e.g., by game number or map ID). Your `List<Game>` is ordered and indexable (e.g., `games[0]` for first game), which fits a "best of" series. Dicts add complexity without value here, and EF doesn't natively support them for owned collections (you'd need custom converters, breaking your pure procedural rule).

#### Updated `Match` Snippet
```csharp
public partial class Match : Entity
{
    // ... other props ...
    public virtual List<Game> Games { get; set; } = new();  // Navigation: Instances only
    // No explicit FK list—handled in Game entity
}
```
- In `Game`: Add `public Guid MatchId { get; set; }` and `public virtual Match Match { get; set; } = null!;` for bidirectional if needed (e.g., `game.Match.WinnerId`).
- EF Config: `modelBuilder.Entity<Match>().HasMany(m => m.Games).WithOne(g => g.Match).HasForeignKey(g => g.MatchId).OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);` (cascade deletes Games if Match is removed).

This closes potential Chasm traps (e.g., querying all Games in a Match) while keeping entities dumb.

### 2. What Does the Database Store for the `Games` Property When Saving a `Match`?
The database **does not create or store copies** of the `Game` instances within the `Match` row. Instead:
- **Match Row**: Only scalar/primitive properties are stored directly in the `matches` table (e.g., `TeamSize`, `StartedAt`, `BestOf`, `AvailableMaps` as `text[]` or JSONB for lists, `StateHistory` as JSONB via Npgsql). The `Games` property is ignored for storage—it's purely a runtime navigation handle.
- **Games Rows**: Each `Game` in the list becomes a separate row(s) in a `games` table, with:
  - Its own scalars (e.g., `Score`, `MapName`—assuming `Game` has them).
  - The FK `MatchId` populated with the `Match.Id` to link back.
- **Overall Storage**:
  - EF Core orchestrates an INSERT for the `Match` first (getting its `Id`), then INSERTs each `Game` with that `Id` as FK.
  - No duplication: Games are independent entities (not owned/value objects), so changes to a `Game` (e.g., updating score) require a separate `context.Update(game); SaveChanges();`.
  - PostgreSQL Specifics: Use `uuid` for Guids, `jsonb` for `StateHistory` or `AvailableMaps` (map via `[Column(TypeName = "jsonb")]`). N+1 queries avoided by including `Include(m => m.Games)`.

Example SQL (simplified, post-SaveChanges):
```sql
-- matches table
INSERT INTO matches (id, teamsize, started_at, ...) VALUES ('guid1', 5, '2025-09-25', ...);

-- games table (for each Game)
INSERT INTO games (id, match_id, score_team1, ...) VALUES ('guid2', 'guid1', 10, ...);
INSERT INTO games (id, match_id, score_team1, ...) VALUES ('guid3', 'guid1', 8, ...);
```
Retrieval: `var match = await context.Matches.Include(m => m.Games).FirstAsync(m => m.Id == id);`—EF reconstructs the `List<Game>` from joined rows.

### 3. Risks of Data-Drift with Navigational Properties Referring to Other Instances?
Yes, there are risks, but they're mitigable and often overstated in well-configured EF setups. Data-drift happens when the in-memory instance (e.g., `match.Games[0]`) diverges from the DB state, leading to stale reads, lost updates, or inconsistencies. Key risks in your context:

- **Stale/Outdated References**:
  - If you load `Match` without `Include(m => m.Games)`, `Games` is empty/unloaded—accessing it triggers lazy-loading (if `virtual`), but in a detached scenario (e.g., API response), it stays null, causing "missing" Games on deserialization.
  - Risk Level: Medium. Mitigation: Always eager-load in queries (`Include/ThenInclude`); disable lazy-loading globally (`optionsBuilder.LazyLoadingEnabled = false;`) to force explicitness, aligning with procedural design.

- **Concurrency and Detached Entities**:
  - Multiple services/contexts editing the same `Match`: One updates a `Game` in-memory, but another saves first, causing optimistic concurrency fails (if using rowversions) or overwrites.
  - Detached graphs (e.g., from API to DB): Nav props like `Games` might reference old instances; `SaveChanges()` could re-insert duplicates if IDs mismatch.
  - Risk Level: High in multi-threaded/Discord-bot scenarios (e.g., real-time match updates). Mitigation: Use short-lived DbContexts per operation; add `[ConcurrencyCheck]` or rowversion (`byte[] RowVersion { get; set; }`); reload via `context.Entry(match).Reference(m => m.Games).Load();` before updates.

- **Circular References and Serialization**:
  - Bidirectional navs (e.g., `Match.Games` ↔ `Game.Match`) cause infinite loops in JSON serialization (e.g., for API responses).
  - Risk Level: Low if not serializing entities directly. Mitigation: Use DTOs (e.g., `MatchDto` with flattened `List<GameDto>`); `[JsonIgnore]` on one side; or Newtonsoft.Json's `ReferenceLoopHandling.Ignore`.

- **Orphaned or Cascaded Deletions**:
  - Deleting a `Match` without `Cascade` orphans `Games` (or vice versa if FKs are nullable).
  - Risk Level: Medium for "best of" matches where Games are incomplete. Mitigation: Set `DeleteBehavior.Cascade` in config; validate in procedural services (e.g., `if (match.Games.Any()) throw new InvalidOperationException();`).

- **Performance/Scale Drift**:
  - Large `Games` lists (e.g., best-of-7) inflate query payloads, causing drift if partial loads are inconsistent.
  - JSONB for `StateHistory` is fine, but if `Games` grows complex, consider archiving to separate tables.
  - Risk Level: Low initially. Mitigation: Paginate collections; use `AsSplitQuery()` for large graphs.

In your PostgreSQL/EF setup, these are low-risk if you stick to explicit queries and single-context ops. Profile with EF logging (`optionsBuilder.LogTo(Console.WriteLine)`); if drift hits, it's usually a sign to add transactions (`using var tx = await context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync();`). Share your `Game` class for more tailored advice!
