# WB002: Missing event bus injection

## Description
Classes marked with the `EventBoundary` attribute must have an injected event bus parameter (either `ICoreEventBus` or `IDiscordEventBus`) in their constructor.

## Why This Matters
Event boundary classes need access to an event bus instance to publish events. Without proper injection, the source generators cannot wire up the event publishing functionality correctly.

## How to Fix
Add the appropriate event bus parameter to your constructor:

```csharp
// For core business logic
[EventBoundary]
public class MyService
{
    public MyService(ICoreEventBus eventBus) // ✅ Correct
    {
        // Constructor logic
    }
}

// For Discord-specific logic
[EventBoundary]
public class MyDiscordHandler
{
    public MyDiscordHandler(IDiscordEventBus eventBus) // ✅ Correct
    {
        // Constructor logic
    }
}
```

## Additional Notes
- Choose `ICoreEventBus` for business logic events
- Choose `IDiscordEventBus` for Discord-specific events
- The source generators will automatically wire up event publishing methods
