# The backup will be placed in a subfolder named after the solution
# Example: "D:\Projects\Backup"

# If false, the script will skip if a backup already exists
# I don't know why I made this configurable, but it's here if you need it

# This creates a safety backup in overwrites_backup folder (one level up)
# Only saves the most recent overwritten backup as a safety measure
# to prevent disk space issues from accumulating many redundant backups
